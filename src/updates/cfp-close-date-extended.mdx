# CFP Close Date Extended

We extend the CFP closing date to **March 10, 2019**, so participants in the
[Global Diversity CFP Day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/) have time to submit their first CFP!

Both JSConf Budapest and [CSSConf Budapest](http://cssconfbp.rocks/) will be open,
and accepting proposals from all over the world, so participants on the workshops have a chance
to enter the lineup in Budapest this September.

For the first time, Budapest also participates in this great program with a local workshop on March 2nd.
Some of our team, and local community members will be there as facilitators or mentors,
and help people attending the workshop on how to write good proposals, slides and prepare for public speaking.

We still have to keep our selection process anonimized, so we'll be extra careful on the workshop
not to break this proven system or exclude someone.
