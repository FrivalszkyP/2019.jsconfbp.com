Its\n      appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from\n      our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided\n      by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to\n      communicate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read{' '}\n      <a href=\"http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html\">\n        this guide.\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <h3>Sexism</h3>\n    <p>\n      Using gendered terms like \"dude\" or \"guys\" to address a mixed-gendered\n      group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented\n      individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as\n      gendered terms.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For more information please familiarise yourself with the{' '}\n      <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language\">\n        Geek Feminism wiki guide.\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Attribution</h2>\n    <p>\n      This Code of Conduct was based on{' '}\n      <a href=\"https://2018.jsconf.eu\">JSConf EU</a>,{' '}\n      <a href=\"http://2018.jsconfau.com/\">CSSConf / JSConf AU</a>,{' '}\n      <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy\">\n        The Geek Feminism wiki\n      </a>\n      , the work of{' '}\n      <a href=\"https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-training/\">\n        Valerie Aurora\n      </a>\n      , <a href=\"https://wealljs.org/code-of-conduct\">WeAllJS</a>, and{' '}\n      <a href=\"http://confcodeofconduct.com/\">Conference Code of Conduct</a>.\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default CodeOfConduct\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
